## Session Log — 2026-06-26

### Bug Fixes Shipped

**1. Cross-device cookie / proxy fix**
- Next.js rewrites `/api/*` → backend so browser never sees a cross-origin request
- `skipTrailingSlashRedirect: true` in `next.config.ts` + trailing slash forced in rewrite destination
- `APPEND_SLASH = False` added to `backend/config/settings.py`
- Fixes Django RuntimeError on POST requests coming through the proxy

**2. Flutter mobile auth (dual-source)**
- `backend/apps/accounts/authentication.py` — `CookieJWTAuthentication` now tries cookie first, then `Authorization: Bearer` header
- Login response now returns `access` + `refresh` tokens in body (in addition to cookies) for Flutter
- Token refresh accepts `refresh` from request body OR cookie — whichever is present

**3. Add Employee modal — dropdowns not loading**
- Root cause: branches API was pointing to wrong path (`/branches/` → fixed to `/branch/branches/`)
- Root cause 2: paginated response returns `{ count, results, ... }` not a flat array — code was calling `.filter()` on the object (silent TypeError)
- Fixed in `frontend/app/dashboard/employees/_components/AddEmployeeModal.tsx`

**4. Employee profile "not found"**
- Page was reading from `MOCK_EMPLOYEES` array (mock IDs had `D` suffix, real IDs don't)
- Added `EmployeeDetailView` to backend (`GET /api/employees/<employee_id>/`)
- Rewrote `frontend/app/dashboard/employees/[id]/page.tsx` to fetch from real API

### Features Shipped

**5. Employee Code Settings** (configurable ID format)
- New singleton model `EmployeeCodeSettings` — prefix, padding, next_sequence
- `generate_employee_id()` uses `select_for_update()` + atomic `F()` increment (safe under concurrent creates)
- Employee creation in `EmployeeListCreateView.post()` now calls `EmployeeCodeSettings.generate_employee_id()` instead of unsafe `count() + 1`
- Settings page: `frontend/app/dashboard/settings/employee-code/page.tsx` — live preview of next 3 IDs
- Card added to `frontend/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`
- Migration: `backend/apps/accounts/migrations/0020_employee_code_settings.py` ✅ applied
- `next_sequence` auto-seeded to `max_existing + 1` on deploy (was 6 as of this session)
- API: `GET/PUT /api/settings/employee-code/` — permission: `CanManageRoles`

**6. Branch-scoped employee list**
- `system_admin` sees all employees, gets a branch switcher dropdown in filter bar (derived client-side from employee list — no extra permission required)
- `hr_admin` sees only their branch (server-enforced in `EmployeeListCreateView.get()`) — fixed branch pill in filter bar, non-editable
- Branch column added to employee table
- `branch` field added to `UserInfo` interface and saved at login

**7. Branches sidebar visibility fix**
- `navConfig.ts` and `proxy.ts` — Branches entry was guarded by `settings.view`; `hr_admin` has `settings.view` so they saw Branches but got 403 from the API
- Fixed: both files now guard Branches with `branches.view`
- `hr_admin` no longer sees Branches in sidebar; proxy also blocks direct URL navigation

### Features Shipped

**1. Attendance Settings API** (`/api/attendance/settings/`)
- `GET` reads current settings (upsert pattern — creates defaults on first call)
- `PUT` full save of all 6 sections (working hours, punch rules, overtime, weekly off, late mark, absence alert)
- `PATCH` partial update — send only changed sections, others untouched
- `first_error()` in `core/responses.py` rewritten to recursively handle nested serializer errors (previously showed generic "Validation error." for nested fields)
- Files: `attendance/serializers_settings.py`, `attendance/services.py`, `attendance/views/settings_view.py`

**2. My Attendance — Clock In / Clock Out** (`POST /api/attendance/punch/`)
- Immutable `AttendancePunch` model — every punch event stored, never overwritten
- Geofencing validated on every office punch using Haversine formula (pure Python, no library)
- Runs `AttendanceProcessorService` synchronously after each punch to keep `AttendanceRecord` current
- Returns full today-session in same response (no second GET needed from frontend)

**3. My Attendance — Dashboard APIs**
- `GET /api/attendance/today/` — ClockWidget: is_clocked_in, punch list, total_seconds, session_seconds
- `GET /api/attendance/stats/` — Stat cards: days_present, late_arrivals, avg_hours, attendance %
- `GET /api/attendance/summary/` — Monthly summary grid: working_days, days_present, absent, leave, half_day, OT hours
- `GET /api/attendance/calendar/` — Per-day calendar data + history table rows

**4. Attendance Correction Request** (`POST /api/attendance/correction/`)
- Employee submits regularization for missed/wrong punch
- Validates: date not in future, correct_in_time required for IN/BOTH, correct_out_time required for OUT/BOTH
- Guard: blocks duplicate pending correction for same date (409)
- Status flow: pending → approved/rejected (approval UI not yet built)

**5. Enterprise Geofencing**
- `Branch` model extended: `latitude`, `longitude`, `allowed_radius_meters` (default 150m), `geofencing_enabled`
- `GET/PUT /api/branch/branches/<pk>/geofencing/` — dedicated geofence config API
- `services_geofencing.py` — strategy pattern: `_MODE_VALIDATORS` maps attendance mode to validator function
- Office mode: Haversine distance → allow if within radius, reject with distance message
- WFH/field/client/remote modes: GPS stored for audit, no distance check
- Branch resolver: matches `User.branch` (CharField) against `Branch.branch_name`, falls back to `branch_code`

**6. Bug Fixes**
- GPS `DecimalField` → `FloatField` in punch serializer — `navigator.geolocation` returns JS floats with 15+ decimal digits which exceeded `max_digits` on DecimalField
- Branch model lat/lon upgraded to `max_digits=12, decimal_places=8` (was 10,7)
- `browser` field `max_length` 100 → 500, `operating_system` 100 → 200 (raw `navigator.userAgent` exceeds 100 chars)
- `TypeError: unsupported operand type Decimal vs float` in Haversine — fixed by casting `float()` before calculation
- CSRF trusted origins added for Django admin in development

### New Models

| Model | Table | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AttendancePunch` | `attendance_punches` | Immutable raw punch events with full GPS + device audit trail |

### Bug Fixes Shipped

**1. Celery connecting to Render Redis instead of local Redis**
- Root cause: `$env:REDIS_URL` was set as a Windows User-level environment variable, overriding `.env` file values
- Fix 1: Cleared the OS variable — `[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('REDIS_URL', $null, 'User')`
- Fix 2: `environ.Env.read_env(BASE_DIR / '.env', overwrite=True)` in `settings.py` — forces `.env` to win over any OS env vars
- Fix 3: Added `CELERY_BROKER_CONNECTION_RETRY_ON_STARTUP = True` to silence Celery 6.0 deprecation warning
- File: `backend/config/settings.py`

**2. Geofencing settings not saving (PATCH returned 200 but saved nothing)**
- Root cause 1: `BranchSerializer.Meta.fields` was missing `latitude`, `longitude`, `allowed_radius_meters`, `geofencing_enabled`, `has_coordinates` — DRF silently dropped unknown fields
- Root cause 2: Inline validation blocked enabling geofencing unless lat/lon were re-sent in the same request, even when the branch already had coordinates in DB
- Fix: Added all 5 geofencing fields to `BranchSerializer`; added explicit `has_coordinates = serializers.BooleanField(read_only=True)` (model `@property` not auto-detected by DRF); moved validation to post-assignment check using `branch.has_coordinates`
- File: `backend/apps/branch/serializers.py`, `backend/apps/branch/views.py`

**3. Geofencing not enforcing for Mumbai employees**
- Root cause: Mumbai branch had `geofencing_enabled=False` and no coordinates in DB — geofence code was correct
- Fix: Data configuration — admin must set lat/lon and enable geofencing per branch via `PUT /api/branch/branches/<pk>/geofencing/`
- Hyderabad HQ was the only branch with geofencing configured at time of diagnosis

**4. Punch times showing UTC instead of IST**
- Root cause: `timezone.now()` is UTC-aware; calling `.time()` directly gives UTC wall-clock time; shift_start/shift_end in `AttendanceWorkingHours` are plain IST times — late/early-exit comparisons were wrong
- Root cause 2: `timezone.now().date()` returns UTC date, which can differ from IST date after midnight IST
- Fix: Added `_ist_time(dt)` helper using `dt.astimezone(_IST).time()`; changed all `now.date()` → `timezone.localdate()` (IST-aware)
- Fix 2: `AttendancePunch.punch_date` property and `punch_time_display` property were calling `.date()` and `.strftime()` directly on UTC datetime — both fixed to use `astimezone(_IST)` first
- Files: `backend/apps/attendance/services_attendance.py`, `backend/apps/attendance/models.py`

### Features Shipped

**5. HR Attendance Management — Full API Suite**

All 11 HR endpoints built and wired. Backend only. Frontend prompts provided.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/attendance/dashboard/` | Dashboard stats (present/absent/late/OT counts) |
| GET | `/api/attendance/records/` | Paginated attendance list with filters |
| GET | `/api/attendance/records/<pk>/` | Single record detail + punch timeline |
| GET | `/api/attendance/overtime/` | OT entries list |
| POST | `/api/attendance/overtime/create/` | Create manual OT entry |
| GET | `/api/attendance/invalid-punches/` | Punches outside geofence or missing pair |
| GET | `/api/attendance/un-punches/` | Employees who punched IN but never punched OUT |
| POST | `/api/attendance/import/` | Bulk CSV import (max 5 MB) |
| GET | `/api/attendance/export/` | CSV export with same filters as list |
| POST | `/api/attendance/reprocess/` | Re-run processor for all employees on a date |
| GET | `/api/attendance/corrections/` | List all employee correction requests |
| PATCH | `/api/attendance/corrections/<pk>/review/` | Approve or reject a correction |

**6. HR Corrections Approval Flow**
- `approve_correction()`: creates `AttendancePunch` with `source='manual'` for the requested IN/OUT/BOTH times, then calls `AttendanceProcessorService.process_day()` — status flips from `incomplete` → `present` / `late`; employee drops off the Un-Punches list
- `reject_correction()`: marks rejected, no punch changes
- `_create_punch()` uses `get_or_create` to stay idempotent (safe to re-approve)
- File: `backend/apps/attendance/services_hr_corrections.py` (new, ~120 lines)

**7. Un-Punches ↔ Corrections Integration**
- `get_unpunches()` now also queries `AttendanceCorrection` for each returned employee on that date
- Each un-punch row now includes `correction_pending: bool` and `correction_id: uuid | null`
- Frontend can use these to show "Pending" badge on the un-punch row and link directly to the correction
- File: `backend/apps/attendance/services_hr_audit.py`

**8. Role-Based Branch Scoping**
- `system_admin` role + Django superusers: see all branches, all data
- `hr_admin` and all other roles: scoped to `user.branch` — cannot query outside their branch regardless of `?branch=` query param
- Two helpers added to `views/hr_attendance.py`:
  - `_is_unrestricted(user)` — checks `user.is_superuser` or `user.role.name == 'system_admin'`
  - `_branch_scope(user, requested)` — returns requested branch for unrestricted users, always returns `user.branch` for restricted users
- Applied to all 8 data endpoints: Dashboard, List, OT List, Invalid Punches, Un-Punches, Reprocess, Corrections List, Export
- File: `backend/apps/attendance/views/hr_attendance.py`

## Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| Next.js rewrites proxy for API | Solves cross-origin cookie problem for all devices on same network |
| `APPEND_SLASH = False` in Django | Prevents 308 redirect loop on POST through proxy |
| Dual-source token auth (cookie + header) | Web uses httpOnly cookies; Flutter mobile uses Bearer header |
| Branch filtering client-side for system_admin | Avoids `branches.view` permission dependency; branches derived from employee list |
| `EmployeeCodeSettings` as singleton (pk=1) | One global format, not per-branch — simpler, consistent employee IDs |
| `select_for_update()` for ID generation | Race-safe under concurrent employee creation |
| `branches.view` guards Branches nav (not `settings.view`) | `hr_admin` has `settings.view` for Settings page — wrong permission caused sidebar leak |

---

## Permissions Reference

| Permission | Who has it |
|---|---|
| `branches.view` | system_admin only |
| `settings.view` | system_admin, hr_admin |
| `employees.view` | system_admin, hr_admin |
| `employees.create` | system_admin, hr_admin |
