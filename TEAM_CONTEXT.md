## Session Log — 2026-06-26

### Bug Fixes Shipped

**1. Cross-device cookie / proxy fix**
- Next.js rewrites `/api/*` → backend so browser never sees a cross-origin request
- `skipTrailingSlashRedirect: true` in `next.config.ts` + trailing slash forced in rewrite destination
- `APPEND_SLASH = False` added to `backend/config/settings.py`
- Fixes Django RuntimeError on POST requests coming through the proxy

**2. Flutter mobile auth (dual-source)**
- `backend/apps/accounts/authentication.py` — `CookieJWTAuthentication` now tries cookie first, then `Authorization: Bearer` header
- Login response now returns `access` + `refresh` tokens in body (in addition to cookies) for Flutter
- Token refresh accepts `refresh` from request body OR cookie — whichever is present

**3. Add Employee modal — dropdowns not loading**
- Root cause: branches API was pointing to wrong path (`/branches/` → fixed to `/branch/branches/`)
- Root cause 2: paginated response returns `{ count, results, ... }` not a flat array — code was calling `.filter()` on the object (silent TypeError)
- Fixed in `frontend/app/dashboard/employees/_components/AddEmployeeModal.tsx`

**4. Employee profile "not found"**
- Page was reading from `MOCK_EMPLOYEES` array (mock IDs had `D` suffix, real IDs don't)
- Added `EmployeeDetailView` to backend (`GET /api/employees/<employee_id>/`)
- Rewrote `frontend/app/dashboard/employees/[id]/page.tsx` to fetch from real API

### Features Shipped

**5. Employee Code Settings** (configurable ID format)
- New singleton model `EmployeeCodeSettings` — prefix, padding, next_sequence
- `generate_employee_id()` uses `select_for_update()` + atomic `F()` increment (safe under concurrent creates)
- Employee creation in `EmployeeListCreateView.post()` now calls `EmployeeCodeSettings.generate_employee_id()` instead of unsafe `count() + 1`
- Settings page: `frontend/app/dashboard/settings/employee-code/page.tsx` — live preview of next 3 IDs
- Card added to `frontend/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`
- Migration: `backend/apps/accounts/migrations/0020_employee_code_settings.py` ✅ applied
- `next_sequence` auto-seeded to `max_existing + 1` on deploy (was 6 as of this session)
- API: `GET/PUT /api/settings/employee-code/` — permission: `CanManageRoles`

**6. Branch-scoped employee list**
- `system_admin` sees all employees, gets a branch switcher dropdown in filter bar (derived client-side from employee list — no extra permission required)
- `hr_admin` sees only their branch (server-enforced in `EmployeeListCreateView.get()`) — fixed branch pill in filter bar, non-editable
- Branch column added to employee table
- `branch` field added to `UserInfo` interface and saved at login

**7. Branches sidebar visibility fix**
- `navConfig.ts` and `proxy.ts` — Branches entry was guarded by `settings.view`; `hr_admin` has `settings.view` so they saw Branches but got 403 from the API
- Fixed: both files now guard Branches with `branches.view`
- `hr_admin` no longer sees Branches in sidebar; proxy also blocks direct URL navigation

### Features Shipped

**1. Attendance Settings API** (`/api/attendance/settings/`)
- `GET` reads current settings (upsert pattern — creates defaults on first call)
- `PUT` full save of all 6 sections (working hours, punch rules, overtime, weekly off, late mark, absence alert)
- `PATCH` partial update — send only changed sections, others untouched
- `first_error()` in `core/responses.py` rewritten to recursively handle nested serializer errors (previously showed generic "Validation error." for nested fields)
- Files: `attendance/serializers_settings.py`, `attendance/services.py`, `attendance/views/settings_view.py`

**2. My Attendance — Clock In / Clock Out** (`POST /api/attendance/punch/`)
- Immutable `AttendancePunch` model — every punch event stored, never overwritten
- Geofencing validated on every office punch using Haversine formula (pure Python, no library)
- Runs `AttendanceProcessorService` synchronously after each punch to keep `AttendanceRecord` current
- Returns full today-session in same response (no second GET needed from frontend)

**3. My Attendance — Dashboard APIs**
- `GET /api/attendance/today/` — ClockWidget: is_clocked_in, punch list, total_seconds, session_seconds
- `GET /api/attendance/stats/` — Stat cards: days_present, late_arrivals, avg_hours, attendance %
- `GET /api/attendance/summary/` — Monthly summary grid: working_days, days_present, absent, leave, half_day, OT hours
- `GET /api/attendance/calendar/` — Per-day calendar data + history table rows

**4. Attendance Correction Request** (`POST /api/attendance/correction/`)
- Employee submits regularization for missed/wrong punch
- Validates: date not in future, correct_in_time required for IN/BOTH, correct_out_time required for OUT/BOTH
- Guard: blocks duplicate pending correction for same date (409)
- Status flow: pending → approved/rejected (approval UI not yet built)

**5. Enterprise Geofencing**
- `Branch` model extended: `latitude`, `longitude`, `allowed_radius_meters` (default 150m), `geofencing_enabled`
- `GET/PUT /api/branch/branches/<pk>/geofencing/` — dedicated geofence config API
- `services_geofencing.py` — strategy pattern: `_MODE_VALIDATORS` maps attendance mode to validator function
- Office mode: Haversine distance → allow if within radius, reject with distance message
- WFH/field/client/remote modes: GPS stored for audit, no distance check
- Branch resolver: matches `User.branch` (CharField) against `Branch.branch_name`, falls back to `branch_code`

**6. Bug Fixes**
- GPS `DecimalField` → `FloatField` in punch serializer — `navigator.geolocation` returns JS floats with 15+ decimal digits which exceeded `max_digits` on DecimalField
- Branch model lat/lon upgraded to `max_digits=12, decimal_places=8` (was 10,7)
- `browser` field `max_length` 100 → 500, `operating_system` 100 → 200 (raw `navigator.userAgent` exceeds 100 chars)
- `TypeError: unsupported operand type Decimal vs float` in Haversine — fixed by casting `float()` before calculation
- CSRF trusted origins added for Django admin in development

### New Models

| Model | Table | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AttendancePunch` | `attendance_punches` | Immutable raw punch events with full GPS + device audit trail |
| `AttendanceRecord` | `attendance_records` | Processed daily result per employee (present/late/absent/half_day) |
| `AttendanceCorrection` | `attendance_corrections` | Regularization requests submitted by employees |

### Migrations Applied

**Author: Teerdaveni**

### Bug Fixes Shipped

**1. Celery connecting to Render Redis instead of local Redis**
- Root cause: `$env:REDIS_URL` was set as a Windows User-level environment variable, overriding `.env` file values
- Fix 1: Cleared the OS variable — `[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('REDIS_URL', $null, 'User')`
- Fix 2: `environ.Env.read_env(BASE_DIR / '.env', overwrite=True)` in `settings.py` — forces `.env` to win over any OS env vars
- Fix 3: Added `CELERY_BROKER_CONNECTION_RETRY_ON_STARTUP = True` to silence Celery 6.0 deprecation warning
- File: `backend/config/settings.py`

**2. Geofencing settings not saving (PATCH returned 200 but saved nothing)**
- Root cause 1: `BranchSerializer.Meta.fields` was missing `latitude`, `longitude`, `allowed_radius_meters`, `geofencing_enabled`, `has_coordinates` — DRF silently dropped unknown fields
- Root cause 2: Inline validation blocked enabling geofencing unless lat/lon were re-sent in the same request, even when the branch already had coordinates in DB
- Fix: Added all 5 geofencing fields to `BranchSerializer`; added explicit `has_coordinates = serializers.BooleanField(read_only=True)` (model `@property` not auto-detected by DRF); moved validation to post-assignment check using `branch.has_coordinates`
- File: `backend/apps/branch/serializers.py`, `backend/apps/branch/views.py`

**3. Geofencing not enforcing for Mumbai employees**
- Root cause: Mumbai branch had `geofencing_enabled=False` and no coordinates in DB — geofence code was correct
- Fix: Data configuration — admin must set lat/lon and enable geofencing per branch via `PUT /api/branch/branches/<pk>/geofencing/`
- Hyderabad HQ was the only branch with geofencing configured at time of diagnosis

**4. Punch times showing UTC instead of IST**
- Root cause: `timezone.now()` is UTC-aware; calling `.time()` directly gives UTC wall-clock time; shift_start/shift_end in `AttendanceWorkingHours` are plain IST times — late/early-exit comparisons were wrong
- Root cause 2: `timezone.now().date()` returns UTC date, which can differ from IST date after midnight IST
- Fix: Added `_ist_time(dt)` helper using `dt.astimezone(_IST).time()`; changed all `now.date()` → `timezone.localdate()` (IST-aware)
- Fix 2: `AttendancePunch.punch_date` property and `punch_time_display` property were calling `.date()` and `.strftime()` directly on UTC datetime — both fixed to use `astimezone(_IST)` first
- Files: `backend/apps/attendance/services_attendance.py`, `backend/apps/attendance/models.py`

### Features Shipped

**5. HR Attendance Management — Full API Suite**

All 11 HR endpoints built and wired. Backend only. Frontend prompts provided.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/attendance/dashboard/` | Dashboard stats (present/absent/late/OT counts) |
| GET | `/api/attendance/records/` | Paginated attendance list with filters |
| GET | `/api/attendance/records/<pk>/` | Single record detail + punch timeline |
| GET | `/api/attendance/overtime/` | OT entries list |
| POST | `/api/attendance/overtime/create/` | Create manual OT entry |
| GET | `/api/attendance/invalid-punches/` | Punches outside geofence or missing pair |
| GET | `/api/attendance/un-punches/` | Employees who punched IN but never punched OUT |
| POST | `/api/attendance/import/` | Bulk CSV import (max 5 MB) |
| GET | `/api/attendance/export/` | CSV export with same filters as list |
| POST | `/api/attendance/reprocess/` | Re-run processor for all employees on a date |
| GET | `/api/attendance/corrections/` | List all employee correction requests |
| PATCH | `/api/attendance/corrections/<pk>/review/` | Approve or reject a correction |

**6. HR Corrections Approval Flow**
- `approve_correction()`: creates `AttendancePunch` with `source='manual'` for the requested IN/OUT/BOTH times, then calls `AttendanceProcessorService.process_day()` — status flips from `incomplete` → `present` / `late`; employee drops off the Un-Punches list
- `reject_correction()`: marks rejected, no punch changes
- `_create_punch()` uses `get_or_create` to stay idempotent (safe to re-approve)
- File: `backend/apps/attendance/services_hr_corrections.py` (new, ~120 lines)

**7. Un-Punches ↔ Corrections Integration**
- `get_unpunches()` now also queries `AttendanceCorrection` for each returned employee on that date
- Each un-punch row now includes `correction_pending: bool` and `correction_id: uuid | null`
- Frontend can use these to show "Pending" badge on the un-punch row and link directly to the correction
- File: `backend/apps/attendance/services_hr_audit.py`

**8. Role-Based Branch Scoping**
- `system_admin` role + Django superusers: see all branches, all data
- `hr_admin` and all other roles: scoped to `user.branch` — cannot query outside their branch regardless of `?branch=` query param
- Two helpers added to `views/hr_attendance.py`:
  - `_is_unrestricted(user)` — checks `user.is_superuser` or `user.role.name == 'system_admin'`
  - `_branch_scope(user, requested)` — returns requested branch for unrestricted users, always returns `user.branch` for restricted users
- Applied to all 8 data endpoints: Dashboard, List, OT List, Invalid Punches, Un-Punches, Reprocess, Corrections List, Export
- File: `backend/apps/attendance/views/hr_attendance.py`

## Session Log — 02-07-2026
**Author: G.Durga Prasad**
**Branch: Backend/Assignments**

### Changes Made

**1. Onboarding wizard URLs cleaned up**
- Removed redundant HTTP methods from `OnboardingView`
- `PATCH /onboarding/` (no-step) → now returns 405, use `PATCH /onboarding/step/<n>/`
- `PUT /onboarding/step/<n>/` → now returns 405, use `PATCH` instead
- `POST /onboarding/step/<n>/` → now returns 405, use `PATCH` instead
- Deleted dead `_patch_full_profile()` private method
- Wizard now has 7 clean URLs with no duplicate functionality

**2. Assessment participation counts on `GET /api/assessments/`**
- Added `assigned_count`, `pending_count`, `in_progress_count`, `completed_count` to `AssessmentSerializer`
- Added `candidates` array inline — each assessment now returns full list of candidates who took it
- Candidate entry includes: name, email, status, attempt_count, pass_score, score_awarded, pass_percentage

**3. `attempt_count` field added to `CandidateAssignment`**
- New `PositiveSmallIntegerField(default=1)` on `CandidateAssignment` model
- Migration `assessments/0004_candidateassignment_attempt_count` created and applied
- `RetryAssessmentView` now increments `attempt_count` on every retry

**4. `AssessmentCandidateSerializer` added**
- New serializer in `assessments/serializers.py`
- Returns: `candidate_id`, `candidate_name`, `candidate_email`, `status`, `attempt_count`, `pass_score`, `score_awarded`, `pass_percentage`, `completed_at`, `created_at`

### Files Changed

```
backend/apps/assessments/
  models.py                    — attempt_count field added to CandidateAssignment
  serializers.py               — AssessmentSerializer updated with counts + candidates; AssessmentCandidateSerializer added
  views/portal.py              — RetryAssessmentView increments attempt_count
  migrations/0004_*            — migration for attempt_count (applied)

backend/apps/accounts/
  views.py                     — OnboardingView: removed redundant HTTP methods, deleted _patch_full_profile()
```

### API Changes

|---|---|
| `GET /api/assessments/` | Now returns counts + full candidates array per assessment |
| `PATCH /onboarding/` | Now returns 405 — use step-based PATCH |
| `PUT /onboarding/step/<n>/` | Now returns 405 — use PATCH |
| `POST /onboarding/step/<n>/` | Now returns 405 — use PATCH |

## Session Log — 2026-07-03
**Author: Teerdaveni**
**Branch: backend/attendance-leave**

### Bug Fixes Shipped

**1. Attendance Calendar — incomplete month coverage**
- Root cause: `get_calendar()` only iterated over existing `AttendanceRecord` rows — days with no record (weekly off, future, absent days) were missing from the response
- Fix: Full month iteration using `calendar.monthrange()`; 4 up-front queries (records, leaves, pending corrections, weekly-off policy) replace N+1 per-day queries
- Status priority order: Holiday > Weekly Off > On Leave > record status > Absent; future days with no special status are omitted
- `STATUS_INCOMPLETE` now maps to label `"Missing Clock Out"` with `regularization_required: true`
- Added `_STATUS_COLOR` module constant mapping each status to a hex color
- New static methods on `AttendanceDashboardService`: `_build_day()`, `_weekly_off_days()`, `_leave_dates()`, `_pending_correction_dates()`
- `_weekly_off_days()`: reads `WeeklyDayPolicy` default → falls back to legacy `AttendanceWeeklyOff` → defaults to Saturday + Sunday
- `_leave_dates()`: single query for approved `LeaveRequest` rows in month range, expanded to set of dates
- `_pending_correction_dates()`: batch query replacing N per-day `_has_pending_correction()` calls
- File: `backend/apps/attendance/services_attendance.py`

**2. `DayRecordSerializer` — new fields added**
- Added `date` (YYYY-MM-DD string), `color` (hex), `regularization_required` (bool)
- File: `backend/apps/attendance/serializers_my_attendance.py`

**3. Assessment portal — 404 for non-candidate users**
- Root cause: `/api/assessments/my/` returned 404 when logged-in user had no linked `Candidate` record (employees, managers, HR admins)
- Fix: Returns `200 {assignments: [], all_complete: true}` instead of 404; also auto-corrects stale `assessment_status` to `complete` for these users
- Fixed `safurasamreen2003@gmail.com` — employee/manager account had stale `assessment_status: pending`
- File: `backend/apps/assessments/views/portal.py`

**4. Leave requests — managers/HR can't see their own pending requests**
- Root cause: `LeaveRequestListCreateView.get()` defaulted to the approval queue for any user with `leave.approve` permission — their own pending leaves were invisible
- Fix: Default scope changed to own requests for all users; `?scope=team` now required to see the approval queue
- Same fix applied to `LeaveStatsView.get()` — stats now reflect own requests by default
- File: `backend/apps/hrms/views/leave.py`

**5. Approve/reject buttons showing to leave applicant**
- Root cause: Serializer had no action flags — frontend used JWT role to decide button visibility
- Fix: Added `can_approve` and `can_cancel` boolean fields to `LeaveRequestSerializer`
  - `can_approve`: True only if requester has `leave.approve` perm AND is NOT the leave owner AND status is pending/l2_pending
  - `can_cancel`: True only if requester IS the leave owner AND status is pending/l2_pending
- Frontend should render action buttons based on these fields, not on role from JWT
- File: `backend/apps/hrms/serializers.py`

### Debugging Done

- **`/api/assessments/my/` 404**: Used Django shell + temporary debug print to trace the request user (`safurasamreen2003@gmail.com`, role=manager, RSS00008) — confirmed no `Candidate` linked
- **Candidate `portal_user` not found**: Shell confirmed `Candidate.objects.filter(portal_user=user)` returns correct result; issue was wrong email used in test (`@email.com` vs `@gmail.com`)
- **Leave not showing for Safura**: Shell confirmed she has 1 pending leave; root cause was scope defaulting to approval queue for approvers

### Data Fixes Applied

| User | Fix |
|---|---|
| `safurasamreen2003@gmail.com` | `assessment_status` corrected to `complete` |
| `taskforce1569@gmail.com` (Samreen) | `assessment_status` corrected to `complete` |
| `safurasamreenshaik@gmail.com` (Samreen) | `assessment_status` corrected to `complete` |
| Candidate ID 7 (G. Durga Prasad) | `portal_user` linked to `rithwikaveera@gmail.com` for testing |

### API Behaviour Changes

| Endpoint | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/leave/requests/` | Managers/HR → approval queue | Everyone → own requests |
| `GET /api/leave/requests/?scope=team` | — | Approval queue for approvers |
| `GET /api/leave/stats/` | Managers/HR → team stats | Own stats |
| `GET /api/leave/stats/?scope=team` | — | Team stats for approvers |
| `GET /api/assessments/my/` | 404 for non-candidate users | 200 with empty assignments |
| `GET /api/attendance/calendar/` | Only days with records returned | All month days; weekly off + leaves included |

### Files Modified

```
backend/apps/attendance/
  services_attendance.py     — get_calendar() rewritten; _STATUS_COLOR added; 4 new static helpers
  serializers_my_attendance.py — DayRecordSerializer: date, color, regularization_required added

backend/apps/assessments/
  views/portal.py            — MyAssessmentView: 404 → 200 empty for non-candidate users

backend/apps/hrms/
  views/leave.py             — LeaveRequestListCreateView + LeaveStatsView: scope default fixed
  serializers.py             — LeaveRequestSerializer: can_approve + can_cancel fields added
```

## Session Log — 2026-07-06
**Author: Teerdaveni**
**Branch: attendance/back/03**

### Features Shipped

**1. Branch-wise leave visibility for HR users**
- `_approval_scope_filter(user)` now returns branch-scoped Q filter for `hr_admin` — if HR has a branch set, only employees in that branch are visible; otherwise falls back to `employee__hr=user`
- `_user_branch(user)` helper added — safely reads `user.branch` CharField
- `_can_hr_access_request(hr_user, leave_request)` guard added — used in `_get_request`, `LeaveApprovalView.get()`, and `LeaveApprovalView.post()` to block cross-branch access with 403
- File: `backend/apps/hrms/views/leave.py`

**2. Two-level leave approval workflow (Manager L1 → HR L2)**
- `_resolve_approval_chain(employee)` — checks `EmployeeApprovalOverride` first, falls back to `ApprovalWorkflowRule`; returns `(l1_approver, l2_approver)`
- `_resolve_approver(role_str, employee)` — maps rule role string to actual User FK
- `LeaveApprovalView.post()` — handles both `REQ_PENDING` (L1) and `REQ_L2_PENDING` (L2) states; promotes to l2_pending after L1 approval if l2_approver exists; deducts balance only on final approval
- File: `backend/apps/hrms/views/leave.py`

**3. Manager applies leave → routes directly to HR (skip L1)**
- Managers skip L1 — their leave is created with `status=REQ_L2_PENDING`, `l1_approver=None`, `l2_approver=HR`
- Other employees follow normal L1 → L2 path
- File: `backend/apps/hrms/views/leave.py` (`LeaveRequestListCreateView.post()`)

**4. `approved_by` / `approved_at` fields in leave response**
- `LeaveRequestSerializer` now has `approved_by` and `approved_at` computed fields
- `approved_by`: shows L2 approver name if L2 has acted, else L1 approver name
- `approved_at`: shows `l2_actioned_at` if available, else `l1_actioned_at`
- File: `backend/apps/hrms/serializers.py`

**5. Duplicate leave date validation**
- Before creating a new leave request, checks for overlapping dates in any active status (`pending`, `l2_pending`, `approved`)
- Uses `start_date__lte=end, end_date__gte=start` overlap query
- Rejected or cancelled leaves do not block re-application for the same dates
- File: `backend/apps/hrms/views/leave.py` (`LeaveRequestListCreateView.post()`)

**6. System admin pagination + branch-wise filtering**
- `GET /api/leave/requests/` now paginates with `default_page_size=20` for all roles
- `?branch=<branch_name>` query param supported for `system_admin` only — case-insensitive filter
- Same branch filter added to `LeaveCalendarView.get()`
- File: `backend/apps/hrms/views/leave.py`

**7. Week-off validation on leave application**
- `_get_weekly_off_days()` helper reads current DB config:
  1. `WeeklyDayPolicy` (is_active=True, is_default=True) → `weekly_off_days` property
  2. Falls back to legacy `AttendanceSettings → AttendanceWeeklyOff`
  3. Defaults to `{'saturday', 'sunday'}` if no DB config
- `LeaveRequestListCreateView.post()` iterates every date in the selected range; if any date is a configured week-off day, returns error: `"{Day} ({date}) is a configured week-off day. Leave cannot be applied on a week-off day."`
- Config changes take effect immediately (reads DB on every request, no server restart needed)
- File: `backend/apps/hrms/views/leave.py`

### Bug Fixes Shipped

**8. `_deduct_balance_safe` TypeError — Q vs F expression**
- Root cause: `Q('used_days') + days` — Q objects are filter expressions, not field references
- Fix: Changed to `F('used_days') + float(leave_request.total_days)`
- Added `F` to imports (`from django.db.models import Count, F, Q`)
- File: `backend/apps/hrms/views/leave.py`

**9. Rejection remarks not saving**
- Root cause: Backend read `request.data.get('remarks')` but Postman/frontend sent `reason`
- Fix: `remarks = (request.data.get('remarks') or request.data.get('reason') or '').strip()` — accepts both field names
- File: `backend/apps/hrms/views/leave.py`

### API Behaviour Changes

| Endpoint | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/leave/requests/` | No pagination | Paginated (20/page) |
| `GET /api/leave/requests/?scope=team` | HR sees all statuses | HR sees only `l2_pending`; manager sees only `pending` |
| `GET /api/leave/requests/?branch=X` | Not supported | system_admin only — filters by branch |
| `POST /api/leave/requests/` | No week-off check | Blocks if any selected date falls on configured week-off day |
| `POST /api/leave/requests/approve/` | L1 approve → straight to approved | L1 approve → l2_pending (if l2 exists); L2 approve → approved + balance deducted |
| `POST /api/leave/requests/approve/` | Only reads `remarks` | Accepts `remarks` or `reason` (both work) |
| `GET /api/leave/requests/<id>/` | Response has no approver info | Returns `approved_by` (name) and `approved_at` (timestamp) |

## Session Log — 2026-07-07
**Author: Teerdaveni**

### Bug Fixes Shipped

**1. Celery Beat `unknown command HELLO` crash loop**
- Root cause 1: Previous session added `?protocol=2` to Redis URL — kombu rejected it with `TypeError: Connection._init_params() got an unexpected keyword argument 'protocol'`
- Fix: Removed `protocol=2` suffix from `_celery_redis_url()` in `settings.py`
- Root cause 2 (original HELLO error): redis-py ≥ 4.0 sends `HELLO 3` to Redis server < 6.0 which does not support it
- Fix: Downgrade redis-py — `pip install "redis>=3.5.3,<4.0"`
- File: `backend/config/settings.py`

**2. Sandwich Leave calculation counted only working days**
- Root cause: `_calc_working_days()` used hardcoded `weekday() < 5` (Mon–Fri) — weekends always skipped regardless of policy
- Fix: Rewrote `_calc_working_days()` to read `_get_weekly_off_days()` from DB and accept optional `policy` param; when `sandwich_leave_enabled=True`, all calendar days in range are counted (including weekends and holidays)
- Week-off blocking validation is now skipped when `sandwich_leave_enabled=True` or `count_weekoffs_as_leave=True`
- File: `backend/apps/hrms/views/leave.py`

### Features Shipped

**3. Leave Policies Module — Full Implementation**

Extended existing `LeavePolicy` model with 30 new fields across 5 rule sections. No new model or service files created — all changes in existing files only.

**New fields on `LeavePolicy` model:**

| Section | Fields |
|---|---|
| Leave Application Rules | `minimum_leave_duration`, `maximum_leave_duration`, `maximum_consecutive_days`, `minimum_notice_period`, `allow_half_day`, `allow_backdated_leave`, `maximum_backdated_days`, `allow_future_leave`, `maximum_future_days` |
| Holiday & Week-off Rules | `sandwich_leave_enabled`, `count_holidays_as_leave`, `count_weekoffs_as_leave` |
| Eligibility Rules | `applicable_branches`, `applicable_departments`, `applicable_designations`, `applicable_employment_types`, `applicable_gender`, `minimum_service_period` |
| Documentation Rules | `attachment_required`, `medical_certificate_required`, `medical_certificate_after_days` |
| Leave Restrictions | `allow_negative_balance`, `convert_to_lop`, `allow_leave_cancellation`, `cancellation_allowed_until` |
| Additional Rules | `allow_probation_leave`, `allow_notice_period_leave`, `allow_leave_extension`, `allow_leave_combination` |

**New APIs:**

| Method | Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/leave/policy/` | Returns all 30 new fields per policy |
| PUT/PATCH | `/api/leave/policy/<leave_type>/` | Updates all fields with cross-field validation |
| POST | `/api/leave/policy/` | Creates custom leave type with all fields |
| DELETE | `/api/leave/policy/<leave_type>/` | Custom types only — built-in 6 are protected |

**Leave application validation wired to policy:**
- `_validate_leave_policy()` helper (47 lines) validates every leave request against the saved policy
- Validates: half-day eligibility, min/max duration, max consecutive days, notice period, backdated/future date rules, attachment requirement, eligibility (branch/dept/gender/service period)
- `convert_to_lop=True`: auto-converts leave type to LWP when balance is insufficient instead of rejecting
- `allow_negative_balance=True`: allows overdraft without error
- Custom leave types now accepted in `LeaveRequestCreateSerializer.validate_leave_type()` (checks `LeavePolicy` for non-built-in types)

**Migration:** `hrms/0009_leavepolicy_application_rules` — applied ✅

### Files Modified

```
backend/apps/hrms/
  models.py                   — 30 new fields on LeavePolicy; GENDER_CHOICES constant added

```

### Frontend Prompts Given

- **Leave Policy APIs**: Full request/response format for all 5 endpoints with field reference table, conditional UI rules (show/hide dependent fields), and leave application error messages
- **Sandwich Leave preview fix**: `calcWorkingDays()` must count all calendar days (not skip weekends) when `sandwich_leave_enabled=True`; read flag from `GET /api/leave/policy/` response for the selected leave type

### Pending

- Frontend implementation of Leave Policies settings page (UI from screenshots provided)
- Frontend day counter fix — "2 working days" preview should show "4 days" when sandwich leave is on
- Leave integration — auto-mark employee `on_leave` in attendance when leave is approved
- Attendance reports — CSV/PDF export for HR

## Session Log — 2026-07-08
**Author: Teerdaveni**

### Features Shipped

**1. Convert Insufficient Balance to LOP — Full Backend Implementation**

Implemented the split-balance logic so that when `convert_to_lop=True` on a `LeavePolicy`, leave requests that exceed the available balance are allowed — available balance is consumed first, and only the excess days become LOP.

**Business rule implemented:**
- `convert_to_lop=OFF`: block submission if balance insufficient (unchanged)
- `convert_to_lop=ON`: allow submission; record `lop_days = requested - available`; `leave_type` stays as original (e.g. `earned`) — NOT converted to LWP

**Example (from requirement):**
- Earned Leave available: 15 days
- Requested: 18 working days
- `lop_days = 3.0`, `leave_type = earned`, `total_days = 18`
- On final approval: 15 days deducted from earned balance, 3 days treated as LOP

**Old behaviour (wrong):**
```python
if policy.convert_to_lop:
    leave_type = LEAVE_LWP  # converted entire leave to LWP
```

**New behaviour (correct):**
```python
if policy.convert_to_lop:
    lop_days = round(total_days - available, 1)  # only excess; leave_type unchanged
```

**Approval deduction fix:**
`_deduct_balance_safe()` now deducts only `total_days - lop_days` from the original leave balance. Previously it deducted `total_days` which would over-deduct.

### Files Modified

```
backend/apps/hrms/
  models.py            — Added lop_days DecimalField(default=0) to LeaveRequest
  serializers.py       — Added lop_days to LeaveRequestSerializer.Meta.fields
  views/leave.py       — Balance check: lop_days computed instead of switching leave_type to LWP
                         _deduct_balance_safe(): deducts (total_days - lop_days) on approval
  migrations/
    0010_leaverequest_lop_days.py  — AddField lop_days to hrms_leave_requests (applied ✅)
```

### API Response (new fields)

```json
{
  "leave_type": "earned",
  "total_days": 18.0,
  "lop_days": 3.0,
  "is_lwp": false
}
```

Frontend derives: `earned_leave_used = total_days - lop_days`

### Frontend Changes Needed (not yet done)

- Leave application form: when `convert_to_lop=true` and requested > available, show breakdown panel instead of "Exceeds balance by Nd"
- Detail/history card: show split `Earned Leave: 15d / LOP: 3d / Total: 18d` when `lop_days > 0`
- HR/approver view: same split display so approver sees what will be deducted

### Pending

- Frontend UI for LOP breakdown (described above)
- Leave integration — auto-mark employee `on_leave` in attendance when leave is approved
- Attendance reports — CSV/PDF export for HR

## Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| Next.js rewrites proxy for API | Solves cross-origin cookie problem for all devices on same network |
| `APPEND_SLASH = False` in Django | Prevents 308 redirect loop on POST through proxy |
| Dual-source token auth (cookie + header) | Web uses httpOnly cookies; Flutter mobile uses Bearer header |
| Branch filtering client-side for system_admin | Avoids `branches.view` permission dependency; branches derived from employee list |
| `EmployeeCodeSettings` as singleton (pk=1) | One global format, not per-branch — simpler, consistent employee IDs |
| `select_for_update()` for ID generation | Race-safe under concurrent employee creation |
| `branches.view` guards Branches nav (not `settings.view`) | `hr_admin` has `settings.view` for Settings page — wrong permission caused sidebar leak |

---

## Permissions Reference

| Permission | Who has it |
|---|---|
| `branches.view` | system_admin only |
| `settings.view` | system_admin, hr_admin |
| `employees.view` | system_admin, hr_admin |
| `employees.create` | system_admin, hr_admin |

## Session Log — 2026-06-30

**Developer:** Rithwika
**Branch:** frontend/Attendance

### Features Shipped

**1. Admin Attendance Page** (`app/dashboard/attendance/page.tsx`)
- 4-tab layout: Attendance, OT Entry, Invalid Punches, Un-punches
- Badge counts on alert tabs (Invalid Punches, Un-punches)
- Stats grid: Present, Absent, Late Arrivals, On Leave

**2. Attendance Tab Components**
- `AttendanceTab.tsx` — date / branch / dept filters, summary chips, full attendance table with status badges, ImportModal trigger
- `ImportModal.tsx` — CSV/XLS import modal with drag-and-drop upload zone
- `OtEntryTab.tsx` — OT entry form (cols-3) + OT records table (Approved / Pending badges)
- `InvalidPunchesTab.tsx` — 3 invalid punch records with error/warn badges and alert banner
- `UnpunchesTab.tsx` — 4 unpunch records with Add Punch fix button

**3. Attendance Rules → moved to Settings**
- `AttendanceSettings.tsx` — refactored to `.card` pattern matching other settings pages; removed Comp-Off Earning Rule and Regularization Policy sections
- Sections kept: Working Hours, Weekly Off Days, Punch Rules, Overtime Rules, Late Mark & LOP Rule, Absence Alert
- `app/dashboard/settings/attendance-config/page.tsx` — new Settings sub-page that hosts AttendanceSettings
- `settings/page.tsx` — Attendance Rules card added with route to `/dashboard/settings/attendance-config`

**4. My Attendance Page** (`app/dashboard/my-attendance/page.tsx`)
- Employee-facing attendance view (no tabs)
- 4 stat cards: Days Present, Late Arrivals, Avg Hours/Day, Attendance %
- Top row (horizontal): ClockWidget + Monthly Summary card (3×2 grid layout)
- Full-width below: Attendance calendar (CalendarGrid + MonthDetail)

**5. Clock Widget** (`my-attendance/_components/ClockWidget.tsx`)
- Live clock with session timer using `useEffect` + `setInterval`
- Clock In / Clock Out toggle updates punch list in real time
- Request Attendance Correction button opens RegularizationModal

**6. RegularizationModal** (`my-attendance/_components/RegularizationModal.tsx`)
- Correction request form: date, punch type, correct in/out times, reason, notes

**7. My Calendar — integrated into My Attendance**
- `CalendarGrid.tsx` — 7-column color-coded calendar grid (DayStatus: Present, Late, Absent, On Leave, Half Day, Weekly Off, Holiday); today highlighted with primary circle
- `MonthDetail.tsx` — detail table for all recorded days (clock in/out, hours, status badge, note)
- `MyCalendarTab.tsx` — wraps CalendarGrid + MonthDetail with month navigation and color legend; used as the right-column of My Attendance
- Separate "My Calendar" nav item removed — calendar lives inside My Attendance

### Layout Decision
My Attendance uses a stacked (vertical) layout instead of side-by-side:
- Row 1: Stats grid (4 KPI cards)
- Row 2: ClockWidget | Monthly Summary (horizontal, 340px + 1fr)
- Row 3: Full-width attendance calendar

This gives the calendar maximum width for readability while keeping the clock always visible.

## Session Log — 2026-07-01

**Developer:** Rithwika
**Branch:** frontend/dynamic

### Features Shipped

**1. My Attendance Page — Full Backend API Integration**
- Rewrote `app/dashboard/my-attendance/page.tsx` using `useAttendanceDashboard` hook
- Layout: ClockWidget + 2×2 stat cards side by side (top row), 6-cell monthly summary grid, tabbed Calendar / History below
- Month navigator: 1-indexed, wraparound (Dec → Jan), Next disabled on current month
- `CorrectionModal` with `key={correctionDate}` — resets form state for each different date

**2. New Hooks**

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `useAttendanceDashboard` | Parallel `useFetch` for `/attendance/stats/`, `/attendance/summary/`, `/attendance/calendar/`; combined `refetch()` |
| `useAttendanceCorrection` | POST `/attendance/correction/`; shows `response.message` toast; calls `onSuccess` callback |

**3. useClockWidget — Full Rewrite**
- Live timer: `session_seconds` + `total_seconds` both tick via `setInterval`; `isClockedIn` boolean as dependency (not session object) to prevent stale closures; functional updater `setSession(prev => ...)` inside interval
- Geolocation: office mode requires GPS — `PERMISSION_DENIED` (code 1) aborts punch with specific toast; codes 2/3 and unsupported browser proceed without coords
- Session state updated directly from POST response body (`res.data.data`) — no extra GET after punch
- Browser field: `parseBrowser()` sends parsed name (Chrome / Edge / Firefox / Safari / Opera / Unknown)
- Added `operating_system` field: `parseOS()` sends parsed OS (Windows 11/10 / macOS / Android / iOS / Linux / Unknown)

**4. New Components**

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `_components/ClockWidget.tsx` | Rewritten — real data from `useClockWidget`; date + status badge; live session timer; mode selector (office/wfh/field/client_location/remote_office); punch button; punch log with geofence dots (green inside / red outside / grey N/A) |
| `_components/CorrectionModal.tsx` | Controlled by `isOpen` + `date` (read-only) + `onClose` + `onSuccess`; conditional IN/OUT time fields per punch type; uses `useAttendanceCorrection` |
| `_components/AttendanceCalendar.tsx` | Month grid using backend lowercase statuses directly; spec status colors (present=green, late=amber, absent=red, half_day=orange, weekly_off=grey, holiday=blue, on_leave=purple); Regularize button per day |
| `_components/AttendanceHistoryTable.tsx` | Table with Date/Day/ClockIn/ClockOut/Hours/Status/Action columns; status badges; Regularize buttons passing `date` string |
| `_components/CalendarAndHistory.tsx` | Tabbed wrapper (Calendar / History tabs); month nav header with prev/next + month label; legend chips; Next button disabled on current month |

**5. ClockInButton (Dashboard) — Updated**
- Switched to new `useClockWidget` return shape (`session` / `isLoading` / `isPunching`)
- `RegularizationModal` → `CorrectionModal` with today's ISO date string

**6. endpoints.ts — geofencing added**
- `attendance.geofencing: (branchPk: number) => \`/branch/branches/${branchPk}/geofencing/\``

**7. types/attendance.ts — Created**
- Canonical backend types with lowercase statuses (`present`, `late`, `absent`, `half_day`, `weekly_off`, `holiday`, `on_leave`)
- Nullable fields (`clockIn: string | null`, `is_inside_geofence: boolean | null`, etc.)
- Exported types: `TodaySession`, `PunchEntry`, `AttendanceStats`, `MonthlySummary`, `DayRecord`, `CalendarResponse`, `HistoryRow`, `PunchType`, `CorrectionReason`, `AttendanceMode`

### API Endpoints Wired

| Endpoint | Method | Hook |
|----------|--------|------|
| `/attendance/today/` | GET | `useClockWidget` |
| `/attendance/punch/` | POST | `useClockWidget` |
| `/attendance/stats/` | GET | `useAttendanceDashboard` |
| `/attendance/summary/` | GET | `useAttendanceDashboard` |
| `/attendance/calendar/` | GET | `useAttendanceDashboard` |
| `/attendance/correction/` | POST | `useAttendanceCorrection` |

### Punch Request Body (current shape)

```json
{
  "punch_type":       "IN | OUT",
  "attendance_mode":  "office | wfh | field | client_location | remote_office",
  "source":           "web",
  "latitude":         12.3456,
  "longitude":        78.9101,
  "accuracy":         15.0,
  "device_time":      "2026-07-01T09:00:00.000Z",
  "browser":          "Chrome",
  "operating_system": "Windows 11/10"
}
```

GPS fields are plain JS floats from `GeolocationCoordinates` — no type conversion applied.

### Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|----------|---------|
| `isClockedIn` boolean as `useEffect` dependency for timer | Session object changes every second; boolean only changes on actual clock-in/out — prevents re-creating the interval every tick |
| Session updated from POST body directly | Avoids an extra GET round-trip; POST response already returns the updated `TodaySession` |
| `key={correctionDate}` on CorrectionModal | Forces remount (state reset) each time a different date is selected for regularization |
| `parseBrowser()` / `parseOS()` helpers | Backend field `browser` accepts up to 500 chars — sending parsed name keeps it clean; `operating_system` is a new backend field |
| Error toasts from `response.message` only | No hardcoded backend error strings; only the geolocation denial message is frontend-authored |
