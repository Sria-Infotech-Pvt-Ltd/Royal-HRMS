## Session Log — 2026-06-26

### Bug Fixes Shipped

**1. Cross-device cookie / proxy fix**
- Next.js rewrites `/api/*` → backend so browser never sees a cross-origin request
- `skipTrailingSlashRedirect: true` in `next.config.ts` + trailing slash forced in rewrite destination
- `APPEND_SLASH = False` added to `backend/config/settings.py`
- Fixes Django RuntimeError on POST requests coming through the proxy

**2. Flutter mobile auth (dual-source)**
- `backend/apps/accounts/authentication.py` — `CookieJWTAuthentication` now tries cookie first, then `Authorization: Bearer` header
- Login response now returns `access` + `refresh` tokens in body (in addition to cookies) for Flutter
- Token refresh accepts `refresh` from request body OR cookie — whichever is present

**3. Add Employee modal — dropdowns not loading**
- Root cause: branches API was pointing to wrong path (`/branches/` → fixed to `/branch/branches/`)
- Root cause 2: paginated response returns `{ count, results, ... }` not a flat array — code was calling `.filter()` on the object (silent TypeError)
- Fixed in `frontend/app/dashboard/employees/_components/AddEmployeeModal.tsx`

**4. Employee profile "not found"**
- Page was reading from `MOCK_EMPLOYEES` array (mock IDs had `D` suffix, real IDs don't)
- Added `EmployeeDetailView` to backend (`GET /api/employees/<employee_id>/`)
- Rewrote `frontend/app/dashboard/employees/[id]/page.tsx` to fetch from real API

### Features Shipped

**5. Employee Code Settings** (configurable ID format)
- New singleton model `EmployeeCodeSettings` — prefix, padding, next_sequence
- `generate_employee_id()` uses `select_for_update()` + atomic `F()` increment (safe under concurrent creates)
- Employee creation in `EmployeeListCreateView.post()` now calls `EmployeeCodeSettings.generate_employee_id()` instead of unsafe `count() + 1`
- Settings page: `frontend/app/dashboard/settings/employee-code/page.tsx` — live preview of next 3 IDs
- Card added to `frontend/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`
- Migration: `backend/apps/accounts/migrations/0020_employee_code_settings.py` ✅ applied
- `next_sequence` auto-seeded to `max_existing + 1` on deploy (was 6 as of this session)
- API: `GET/PUT /api/settings/employee-code/` — permission: `CanManageRoles`

**6. Branch-scoped employee list**
- `system_admin` sees all employees, gets a branch switcher dropdown in filter bar (derived client-side from employee list — no extra permission required)
- `hr_admin` sees only their branch (server-enforced in `EmployeeListCreateView.get()`) — fixed branch pill in filter bar, non-editable
- Branch column added to employee table
- `branch` field added to `UserInfo` interface and saved at login

**7. Branches sidebar visibility fix**
- `navConfig.ts` and `proxy.ts` — Branches entry was guarded by `settings.view`; `hr_admin` has `settings.view` so they saw Branches but got 403 from the API
- Fixed: both files now guard Branches with `branches.view`
- `hr_admin` no longer sees Branches in sidebar; proxy also blocks direct URL navigation

### Features Shipped

**1. Attendance Settings API** (`/api/attendance/settings/`)
- `GET` reads current settings (upsert pattern — creates defaults on first call)
- `PUT` full save of all 6 sections (working hours, punch rules, overtime, weekly off, late mark, absence alert)
- `PATCH` partial update — send only changed sections, others untouched
- `first_error()` in `core/responses.py` rewritten to recursively handle nested serializer errors (previously showed generic "Validation error." for nested fields)
- Files: `attendance/serializers_settings.py`, `attendance/services.py`, `attendance/views/settings_view.py`

**2. My Attendance — Clock In / Clock Out** (`POST /api/attendance/punch/`)
- Immutable `AttendancePunch` model — every punch event stored, never overwritten
- Geofencing validated on every office punch using Haversine formula (pure Python, no library)
- Runs `AttendanceProcessorService` synchronously after each punch to keep `AttendanceRecord` current
- Returns full today-session in same response (no second GET needed from frontend)

**3. My Attendance — Dashboard APIs**
- `GET /api/attendance/today/` — ClockWidget: is_clocked_in, punch list, total_seconds, session_seconds
- `GET /api/attendance/stats/` — Stat cards: days_present, late_arrivals, avg_hours, attendance %
- `GET /api/attendance/summary/` — Monthly summary grid: working_days, days_present, absent, leave, half_day, OT hours
- `GET /api/attendance/calendar/` — Per-day calendar data + history table rows

**4. Attendance Correction Request** (`POST /api/attendance/correction/`)
- Employee submits regularization for missed/wrong punch
- Validates: date not in future, correct_in_time required for IN/BOTH, correct_out_time required for OUT/BOTH
- Guard: blocks duplicate pending correction for same date (409)
- Status flow: pending → approved/rejected (approval UI not yet built)

**5. Enterprise Geofencing**
- `Branch` model extended: `latitude`, `longitude`, `allowed_radius_meters` (default 150m), `geofencing_enabled`
- `GET/PUT /api/branch/branches/<pk>/geofencing/` — dedicated geofence config API
- `services_geofencing.py` — strategy pattern: `_MODE_VALIDATORS` maps attendance mode to validator function
- Office mode: Haversine distance → allow if within radius, reject with distance message
- WFH/field/client/remote modes: GPS stored for audit, no distance check
- Branch resolver: matches `User.branch` (CharField) against `Branch.branch_name`, falls back to `branch_code`

**6. Bug Fixes**
- GPS `DecimalField` → `FloatField` in punch serializer — `navigator.geolocation` returns JS floats with 15+ decimal digits which exceeded `max_digits` on DecimalField
- Branch model lat/lon upgraded to `max_digits=12, decimal_places=8` (was 10,7)
- `browser` field `max_length` 100 → 500, `operating_system` 100 → 200 (raw `navigator.userAgent` exceeds 100 chars)
- `TypeError: unsupported operand type Decimal vs float` in Haversine — fixed by casting `float()` before calculation
- CSRF trusted origins added for Django admin in development

### New Models

| Model | Table | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AttendancePunch` | `attendance_punches` | Immutable raw punch events with full GPS + device audit trail |
| `AttendanceRecord` | `attendance_records` | Processed daily result per employee (present/late/absent/half_day) |
| `AttendanceCorrection` | `attendance_corrections` | Regularization requests submitted by employees |

**Author: Teerdaveni**

### Bug Fixes Shipped

**1. Celery connecting to Render Redis instead of local Redis**
- Root cause: `$env:REDIS_URL` was set as a Windows User-level environment variable, overriding `.env` file values
- Fix 1: Cleared the OS variable — `[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('REDIS_URL', $null, 'User')`
- Fix 2: `environ.Env.read_env(BASE_DIR / '.env', overwrite=True)` in `settings.py` — forces `.env` to win over any OS env vars
- Fix 3: Added `CELERY_BROKER_CONNECTION_RETRY_ON_STARTUP = True` to silence Celery 6.0 deprecation warning
- File: `backend/config/settings.py`

**2. Geofencing settings not saving (PATCH returned 200 but saved nothing)**
- Root cause 1: `BranchSerializer.Meta.fields` was missing `latitude`, `longitude`, `allowed_radius_meters`, `geofencing_enabled`, `has_coordinates` — DRF silently dropped unknown fields
- Root cause 2: Inline validation blocked enabling geofencing unless lat/lon were re-sent in the same request, even when the branch already had coordinates in DB
- Fix: Added all 5 geofencing fields to `BranchSerializer`; added explicit `has_coordinates = serializers.BooleanField(read_only=True)` (model `@property` not auto-detected by DRF); moved validation to post-assignment check using `branch.has_coordinates`
- File: `backend/apps/branch/serializers.py`, `backend/apps/branch/views.py`

**3. Geofencing not enforcing for Mumbai employees**
- Root cause: Mumbai branch had `geofencing_enabled=False` and no coordinates in DB — geofence code was correct
- Fix: Data configuration — admin must set lat/lon and enable geofencing per branch via `PUT /api/branch/branches/<pk>/geofencing/`
- Hyderabad HQ was the only branch with geofencing configured at time of diagnosis

**4. Punch times showing UTC instead of IST**
- Root cause: `timezone.now()` is UTC-aware; calling `.time()` directly gives UTC wall-clock time; shift_start/shift_end in `AttendanceWorkingHours` are plain IST times — late/early-exit comparisons were wrong
- Root cause 2: `timezone.now().date()` returns UTC date, which can differ from IST date after midnight IST
- Fix: Added `_ist_time(dt)` helper using `dt.astimezone(_IST).time()`; changed all `now.date()` → `timezone.localdate()` (IST-aware)
- Fix 2: `AttendancePunch.punch_date` property and `punch_time_display` property were calling `.date()` and `.strftime()` directly on UTC datetime — both fixed to use `astimezone(_IST)` first
- Files: `backend/apps/attendance/services_attendance.py`, `backend/apps/attendance/models.py`

### Features Shipped

**5. HR Attendance Management — Full API Suite**

All 11 HR endpoints built and wired. Backend only. Frontend prompts provided.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/attendance/dashboard/` | Dashboard stats (present/absent/late/OT counts) |
| GET | `/api/attendance/records/` | Paginated attendance list with filters |
| GET | `/api/attendance/records/<pk>/` | Single record detail + punch timeline |
| GET | `/api/attendance/overtime/` | OT entries list |
| POST | `/api/attendance/overtime/create/` | Create manual OT entry |
| GET | `/api/attendance/invalid-punches/` | Punches outside geofence or missing pair |
| GET | `/api/attendance/un-punches/` | Employees who punched IN but never punched OUT |
| POST | `/api/attendance/import/` | Bulk CSV import (max 5 MB) |
| GET | `/api/attendance/export/` | CSV export with same filters as list |
| POST | `/api/attendance/reprocess/` | Re-run processor for all employees on a date |
| GET | `/api/attendance/corrections/` | List all employee correction requests |
| PATCH | `/api/attendance/corrections/<pk>/review/` | Approve or reject a correction |

**6. HR Corrections Approval Flow**
- `approve_correction()`: creates `AttendancePunch` with `source='manual'` for the requested IN/OUT/BOTH times, then calls `AttendanceProcessorService.process_day()` — status flips from `incomplete` → `present` / `late`; employee drops off the Un-Punches list
- `reject_correction()`: marks rejected, no punch changes
- `_create_punch()` uses `get_or_create` to stay idempotent (safe to re-approve)
- File: `backend/apps/attendance/services_hr_corrections.py` (new, ~120 lines)

**7. Un-Punches ↔ Corrections Integration**
- `get_unpunches()` now also queries `AttendanceCorrection` for each returned employee on that date
- Each un-punch row now includes `correction_pending: bool` and `correction_id: uuid | null`
- Frontend can use these to show "Pending" badge on the un-punch row and link directly to the correction
- File: `backend/apps/attendance/services_hr_audit.py`

**8. Role-Based Branch Scoping**
- `system_admin` role + Django superusers: see all branches, all data
- `hr_admin` and all other roles: scoped to `user.branch` — cannot query outside their branch regardless of `?branch=` query param
- Two helpers added to `views/hr_attendance.py`:
  - `_is_unrestricted(user)` — checks `user.is_superuser` or `user.role.name == 'system_admin'`
  - `_branch_scope(user, requested)` — returns requested branch for unrestricted users, always returns `user.branch` for restricted users
- Applied to all 8 data endpoints: Dashboard, List, OT List, Invalid Punches, Un-Punches, Reprocess, Corrections List, Export
- File: `backend/apps/attendance/views/hr_attendance.py`

## Session Log — 02-07-2026
**Author: G.Durga Prasad**
**Branch: Backend/Assignments**

### Changes Made

**1. Onboarding wizard URLs cleaned up**
- Removed redundant HTTP methods from `OnboardingView`
- `PATCH /onboarding/` (no-step) → now returns 405, use `PATCH /onboarding/step/<n>/`
- `PUT /onboarding/step/<n>/` → now returns 405, use `PATCH` instead
- `POST /onboarding/step/<n>/` → now returns 405, use `PATCH` instead
- Deleted dead `_patch_full_profile()` private method
- Wizard now has 7 clean URLs with no duplicate functionality

**2. Assessment participation counts on `GET /api/assessments/`**
- Added `assigned_count`, `pending_count`, `in_progress_count`, `completed_count` to `AssessmentSerializer`
- Added `candidates` array inline — each assessment now returns full list of candidates who took it
- Candidate entry includes: name, email, status, attempt_count, pass_score, score_awarded, pass_percentage

**3. `attempt_count` field added to `CandidateAssignment`**
- New `PositiveSmallIntegerField(default=1)` on `CandidateAssignment` model
- Migration `assessments/0004_candidateassignment_attempt_count` created and applied
- `RetryAssessmentView` now increments `attempt_count` on every retry

**4. `AssessmentCandidateSerializer` added**
- New serializer in `assessments/serializers.py`
- Returns: `candidate_id`, `candidate_name`, `candidate_email`, `status`, `attempt_count`, `pass_score`, `score_awarded`, `pass_percentage`, `completed_at`, `created_at`

### Files Changed

```
backend/apps/assessments/
  models.py                    — attempt_count field added to CandidateAssignment
  serializers.py               — AssessmentSerializer updated with counts + candidates; AssessmentCandidateSerializer added
  views/portal.py              — RetryAssessmentView increments attempt_count

## Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| Next.js rewrites proxy for API | Solves cross-origin cookie problem for all devices on same network |
| `APPEND_SLASH = False` in Django | Prevents 308 redirect loop on POST through proxy |
| Dual-source token auth (cookie + header) | Web uses httpOnly cookies; Flutter mobile uses Bearer header |
| Branch filtering client-side for system_admin | Avoids `branches.view` permission dependency; branches derived from employee list |
| `EmployeeCodeSettings` as singleton (pk=1) | One global format, not per-branch — simpler, consistent employee IDs |
| `select_for_update()` for ID generation | Race-safe under concurrent employee creation |
| `branches.view` guards Branches nav (not `settings.view`) | `hr_admin` has `settings.view` for Settings page — wrong permission caused sidebar leak |

---

## Permissions Reference

| Permission | Who has it |
|---|---|
| `branches.view` | system_admin only |
| `settings.view` | system_admin, hr_admin |
| `employees.view` | system_admin, hr_admin |
| `employees.create` | system_admin, hr_admin |

## Session Log — 2026-06-30

**Developer:** Rithwika
**Branch:** frontend/Attendance

### Features Shipped

**1. Admin Attendance Page** (`app/dashboard/attendance/page.tsx`)
- 4-tab layout: Attendance, OT Entry, Invalid Punches, Un-punches
- Badge counts on alert tabs (Invalid Punches, Un-punches)
- Stats grid: Present, Absent, Late Arrivals, On Leave

**2. Attendance Tab Components**
- `AttendanceTab.tsx` — date / branch / dept filters, summary chips, full attendance table with status badges, ImportModal trigger
- `ImportModal.tsx` — CSV/XLS import modal with drag-and-drop upload zone
- `OtEntryTab.tsx` — OT entry form (cols-3) + OT records table (Approved / Pending badges)
- `InvalidPunchesTab.tsx` — 3 invalid punch records with error/warn badges and alert banner
- `UnpunchesTab.tsx` — 4 unpunch records with Add Punch fix button

**3. Attendance Rules → moved to Settings**
- `AttendanceSettings.tsx` — refactored to `.card` pattern matching other settings pages; removed Comp-Off Earning Rule and Regularization Policy sections
- Sections kept: Working Hours, Weekly Off Days, Punch Rules, Overtime Rules, Late Mark & LOP Rule, Absence Alert
- `app/dashboard/settings/attendance-config/page.tsx` — new Settings sub-page that hosts AttendanceSettings
- `settings/page.tsx` — Attendance Rules card added with route to `/dashboard/settings/attendance-config`

**4. My Attendance Page** (`app/dashboard/my-attendance/page.tsx`)
- Employee-facing attendance view (no tabs)
- 4 stat cards: Days Present, Late Arrivals, Avg Hours/Day, Attendance %
- Top row (horizontal): ClockWidget + Monthly Summary card (3×2 grid layout)
- Full-width below: Attendance calendar (CalendarGrid + MonthDetail)

**5. Clock Widget** (`my-attendance/_components/ClockWidget.tsx`)
- Live clock with session timer using `useEffect` + `setInterval`
- Clock In / Clock Out toggle updates punch list in real time
- Request Attendance Correction button opens RegularizationModal

**6. RegularizationModal** (`my-attendance/_components/RegularizationModal.tsx`)
- Correction request form: date, punch type, correct in/out times, reason, notes

**7. My Calendar — integrated into My Attendance**
- `CalendarGrid.tsx` — 7-column color-coded calendar grid (DayStatus: Present, Late, Absent, On Leave, Half Day, Weekly Off, Holiday); today highlighted with primary circle
- `MonthDetail.tsx` — detail table for all recorded days (clock in/out, hours, status badge, note)
- `MyCalendarTab.tsx` — wraps CalendarGrid + MonthDetail with month navigation and color legend; used as the right-column of My Attendance
- Separate "My Calendar" nav item removed — calendar lives inside My Attendance

### Layout Decision
My Attendance uses a stacked (vertical) layout instead of side-by-side:
- Row 1: Stats grid (4 KPI cards)
- Row 2: ClockWidget | Monthly Summary (horizontal, 340px + 1fr)
- Row 3: Full-width attendance calendar

This gives the calendar maximum width for readability while keeping the clock always visible.

## Session Log — 2026-07-01

**Developer:** Rithwika
**Branch:** frontend/dynamic

### Features Shipped

**1. My Attendance Page — Full Backend API Integration**
- Rewrote `app/dashboard/my-attendance/page.tsx` using `useAttendanceDashboard` hook
- Layout: ClockWidget + 2×2 stat cards side by side (top row), 6-cell monthly summary grid, tabbed Calendar / History below
- Month navigator: 1-indexed, wraparound (Dec → Jan), Next disabled on current month
- `CorrectionModal` with `key={correctionDate}` — resets form state for each different date

**2. New Hooks**

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `useAttendanceDashboard` | Parallel `useFetch` for `/attendance/stats/`, `/attendance/summary/`, `/attendance/calendar/`; combined `refetch()` |
| `useAttendanceCorrection` | POST `/attendance/correction/`; shows `response.message` toast; calls `onSuccess` callback |

**3. useClockWidget — Full Rewrite**
- Live timer: `session_seconds` + `total_seconds` both tick via `setInterval`; `isClockedIn` boolean as dependency (not session object) to prevent stale closures; functional updater `setSession(prev => ...)` inside interval
- Geolocation: office mode requires GPS — `PERMISSION_DENIED` (code 1) aborts punch with specific toast; codes 2/3 and unsupported browser proceed without coords
- Session state updated directly from POST response body (`res.data.data`) — no extra GET after punch
- Browser field: `parseBrowser()` sends parsed name (Chrome / Edge / Firefox / Safari / Opera / Unknown)
- Added `operating_system` field: `parseOS()` sends parsed OS (Windows 11/10 / macOS / Android / iOS / Linux / Unknown)

**4. New Components**

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `_components/ClockWidget.tsx` | Rewritten — real data from `useClockWidget`; date + status badge; live session timer; mode selector (office/wfh/field/client_location/remote_office); punch button; punch log with geofence dots (green inside / red outside / grey N/A) |
| `_components/CorrectionModal.tsx` | Controlled by `isOpen` + `date` (read-only) + `onClose` + `onSuccess`; conditional IN/OUT time fields per punch type; uses `useAttendanceCorrection` |
| `_components/AttendanceCalendar.tsx` | Month grid using backend lowercase statuses directly; spec status colors (present=green, late=amber, absent=red, half_day=orange, weekly_off=grey, holiday=blue, on_leave=purple); Regularize button per day |
| `_components/AttendanceHistoryTable.tsx` | Table with Date/Day/ClockIn/ClockOut/Hours/Status/Action columns; status badges; Regularize buttons passing `date` string |
| `_components/CalendarAndHistory.tsx` | Tabbed wrapper (Calendar / History tabs); month nav header with prev/next + month label; legend chips; Next button disabled on current month |

**5. ClockInButton (Dashboard) — Updated**
- Switched to new `useClockWidget` return shape (`session` / `isLoading` / `isPunching`)
- `RegularizationModal` → `CorrectionModal` with today's ISO date string

**6. endpoints.ts — geofencing added**
- `attendance.geofencing: (branchPk: number) => \`/branch/branches/${branchPk}/geofencing/\``

**7. types/attendance.ts — Created**
- Canonical backend types with lowercase statuses (`present`, `late`, `absent`, `half_day`, `weekly_off`, `holiday`, `on_leave`)
- Nullable fields (`clockIn: string | null`, `is_inside_geofence: boolean | null`, etc.)
- Exported types: `TodaySession`, `PunchEntry`, `AttendanceStats`, `MonthlySummary`, `DayRecord`, `CalendarResponse`, `HistoryRow`, `PunchType`, `CorrectionReason`, `AttendanceMode`

### API Endpoints Wired

| Endpoint | Method | Hook |
|----------|--------|------|
| `/attendance/today/` | GET | `useClockWidget` |
| `/attendance/punch/` | POST | `useClockWidget` |
| `/attendance/stats/` | GET | `useAttendanceDashboard` |
| `/attendance/summary/` | GET | `useAttendanceDashboard` |
| `/attendance/calendar/` | GET | `useAttendanceDashboard` |
| `/attendance/correction/` | POST | `useAttendanceCorrection` |

### Punch Request Body (current shape)

```json
{
  "punch_type":       "IN | OUT",
  "attendance_mode":  "office | wfh | field | client_location | remote_office",
  "source":           "web",
  "latitude":         12.3456,
  "longitude":        78.9101,
  "accuracy":         15.0,
  "device_time":      "2026-07-01T09:00:00.000Z",
  "browser":          "Chrome",
  "operating_system": "Windows 11/10"
}
```

GPS fields are plain JS floats from `GeolocationCoordinates` — no type conversion applied.

### Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|----------|---------|
| `isClockedIn` boolean as `useEffect` dependency for timer | Session object changes every second; boolean only changes on actual clock-in/out — prevents re-creating the interval every tick |
| Session updated from POST body directly | Avoids an extra GET round-trip; POST response already returns the updated `TodaySession` |
| `key={correctionDate}` on CorrectionModal | Forces remount (state reset) each time a different date is selected for regularization |
| `parseBrowser()` / `parseOS()` helpers | Backend field `browser` accepts up to 500 chars — sending parsed name keeps it clean; `operating_system` is a new backend field |
| Error toasts from `response.message` only | No hardcoded backend error strings; only the geolocation denial message is frontend-authored |

## Session Log — 03-07-2026
**Author: G.Durga Prasad**
**Branch: Backend/Assignment-Update**

### Bug Fixes Shipped

**1. Employee portal blocked on all assessment actions**
- `RespondToItemView`, `CompleteAssessmentView`, `RetryAssessmentView` all returned 404 for users without a `Candidate` profile (i.e. existing employees)
- Fix: added `_resolve_assignment(user, assignment_id)` helper that checks candidate first, then falls back to `employee=user`
- All three views now use this helper — employee path works identically to candidate path

**2. Naive datetime crash with `USE_TZ=True`**
- `parse_datetime("2026-08-31T23:59:59")` returns a timezone-naive datetime
- Django raises `ValueError` when saving with `USE_TZ=True`
- Fix: added `tz.make_aware(deadline)` guard — `if tz.is_naive(deadline): deadline = tz.make_aware(deadline)`
- File: `assessments/views/admin.py` `AssignAssessmentView`

**3. `CandidateAssignment.__str__` crash when `candidate=None`**
- Employee assignments have `candidate=None`; the original `__str__` dereferenced `self.candidate.name` unconditionally → `AttributeError`
- Fix: `if/elif` branch — candidate → `candidate.name`; employee → `employee.email`; else → `'Unknown'`

**4. `CandidateResponse.__str__` crash — same root cause**
- Same unconditional deref pattern in `CandidateResponse.__str__`
- Fix: same `if/elif` branch pattern applied

**5. N+1 on assessment list**
- `AssessmentSerializer.get_candidates()` called `obj.assignments.select_related(...)` directly, bypassing the prefetch cache — every assessment triggered a fresh query
- Fix: added `Prefetch('assignments', queryset=assignments_qs)` in `AssessmentListCreateView.get()` and changed `get_candidates()` to use `obj.assignments.all()` to read from the prefetch cache

### Features Shipped

**6. Assessment Settings API** (global defaults — configure once, apply everywhere)
- New `AssessmentSettings` singleton model (db_table=`assessments_settings`, pk=1)
- Fields: `default_pass_percentage` (default 70), `max_attempts` (default 3, 0=unlimited), `time_limit_mins` (nullable, None=no limit)
- `AssessmentSettings.load()` classmethod — `get_or_create(pk=1)` singleton pattern
- `GET /api/assessments/settings/` — retrieve global defaults (requires `assessments.view`)
- `PUT /api/assessments/settings/` — update global defaults (requires `assessments.edit`)
- Per-assessment overrides: `max_attempts` (nullable) and `time_limit_mins` (nullable) added to `Assessment` model
- `Assessment.effective_max_attempts(settings)` and `Assessment.effective_time_limit_mins(settings)` — return per-assessment override if set, else global default
- Files: `assessments/views/settings.py` (new), `AssessmentSettingsSerializer` added to serializers

**7. Portal enforces max attempts and tracks `started_at`**
- `RetryAssessmentView` checks `effective_max_attempts(settings)` and returns 403 if attempts exhausted (0=unlimited bypasses check)
- `RespondToItemView` sets `assignment.started_at = timezone.now()` on the first response; resets to None on retry
- `PortalAssignmentSerializer` now returns `effective_max_attempts`, `attempts_remaining`, `time_limit_mins`, `time_remaining_secs`, `started_at`

**8. Per-section scoring**
- New `AssessmentSection` model (db_table=`assessments_section`) — `title`, `order`, `score` (total marks for the section)
- `section` nullable FK added to `AssessmentItem` → `AssessmentSection` (SET_NULL on delete — items become unsectioned, not deleted)
- `Assessment.compute_max_score()` — sums section scores if sections exist; falls back to raw quiz count for unsectioned assessments (backwards compatible)
- `AssignAssessmentView` now uses `assessment.compute_max_score()` instead of hardcoded quiz count
- `CompleteAssessmentView` calls `_compute_weighted_result(assignment)`: `round((correct_in_section / total_in_section) × section.score)` per section; writes weighted values to `assignment.score` and `assignment.max_score`
- Unsectioned quiz items fall back to 1 mark each (backwards compatible)
- `sections_breakdown` in `ResultsAssignmentSerializer` and `AssessmentCandidateSerializer` (completed only): `{section_id, title, max_score, achieved_score, correct_answers, total_questions, percentage}`

**9. Section CRUD endpoints**
- `GET  /api/assessments/<id>/sections/` — list sections with item counts
- `POST /api/assessments/<id>/sections/` — create a section
- `PUT    /api/assessments/<id>/sections/<section_id>/` — update section title/order/score
- `DELETE /api/assessments/<id>/sections/<section_id>/` — delete section (items unlinked, not deleted)
- Files: `assessments/views/sections.py` (new)

### New Files

```
backend/apps/assessments/
  views/settings.py              — AssessmentSettingsView (GET/PUT)
  views/sections.py              — AssessmentSectionListCreateView, AssessmentSectionDetailView
```

### Files Modified

```
backend/apps/assessments/
  models.py                      — AssessmentSettings; max_attempts + time_limit_mins on Assessment;
                                   compute_max_score(); AssessmentSection; section FK on AssessmentItem;
                                   started_at on CandidateAssignment; fixed __str__ crashes on both models
  serializers.py                 — AssessmentSettingsSerializer; AssessmentSectionSerializer (+Create);
                                   _section_breakdown() helper; PortalAssignmentSerializer (time/attempts);
                                   ResultsAssignmentSerializer + AssessmentCandidateSerializer (sections_breakdown)
  views/admin.py                 — Prefetch fix (N+1); naive datetime fix; settings context to serializers;
                                   compute_max_score() for assign; sections prefetch on CandidateResultsView
  views/portal.py                — _resolve_assignment(); _sync_user_assessment_status();
                                   _compute_weighted_result(); started_at tracking; max_attempts on retry
  urls.py                        — settings/, <id>/sections/, <id>/sections/<sid>/ routes added
```

### API Changes

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/assessments/settings/` | Retrieve global assessment defaults |
| PUT | `/api/assessments/settings/` | Update global defaults (pass%, max_attempts, time_limit) |
| GET | `/api/assessments/<id>/sections/` | List sections for an assessment |
| POST | `/api/assessments/<id>/sections/` | Create a section |
| PUT | `/api/assessments/<id>/sections/<sid>/` | Update section |
| DELETE | `/api/assessments/<id>/sections/<sid>/` | Delete section (items unlinked, not deleted) |

### Migrations Applied

```
assessments/0008_assessmentsettings_assessment_max_attempts_and_more  ✅ applied
assessments/0009_assessmentsection_assessmentitem_section             ✅ applied
```

**10. `AssignAssessmentView` — employee ID sent as `candidate_id` crashes with 500**
- Root cause: frontend was sending `candidate_id: "RSS00025"` (an employee code string) because the assign modal used the same field for both candidates and employees
- Backend did `Candidate.objects.get(pk="RSS00025")` — Django tried to cast `"RSS00025"` to an integer/UUID, raised `ValueError`, returned 500
- Fix: added UUID format check before routing — if `candidate_id` is not a valid UUID, it is automatically treated as an `employee_id` and routed to the employee lookup path (`User.objects.get(employee_id=...)`)
- No migration required — view-only change
- File: `assessments/views/admin.py` `AssignAssessmentView.post()`

**Author: G.Durga Prasad**
**Branch: Backend/Assignment-Update**

### Features Shipped

**1. Referral endpoints — 5 new API routes**

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/recruitment/referrals/` | List referrals submitted by the logged-in employee (paginated) |
| POST | `/api/recruitment/referrals/` | Employee submits a new referral |
| GET | `/api/recruitment/referrals/all/` | Admin views all referrals across all employees (paginated) |
| GET | `/api/recruitment/referral-rules/` | List active referral rules (public, for portal) |
| POST | `/api/recruitment/referral-rules/` | Admin creates a new referral rule |
| PATCH | `/api/recruitment/referral-rules/<id>/` | Admin updates a referral rule |
| DELETE | `/api/recruitment/referral-rules/<id>/` | Admin deletes a referral rule |

**2. `ReferralRule` model added**
- New model in `recruitment/models.py` — `icon`, `title`, `body`, `order`, `is_active`
- Uses `AutoField` (int PK) — intentional exception to UUID rule; these are static reference rows
- `db_table = 'referral_rule'`, `ordering = ['order']`
- Migration `0004_referralrule` created ✅

**3. Referral rule seed data**
- Migration `0005_referralrule_seed` seeds 6 default rules (Eligibility, Referral Bonus, No Self-Referral, Cooling Period, Active Referral Limit, Tax & Payroll) using `get_or_create` ✅

**4. Referral email templates seeded**
- Migration `0006_referral_email_templates` seeds 4 templates using `get_or_create`:
  - `referral_submitted_referrer` — sent to referrer when their referral is received
  - `referral_submitted_candidate` — sent to referred candidate confirming referral
  - `referral_interview_scheduled_candidate` — sent to referred candidate when interview is scheduled
  - `referral_interview_scheduled_referrer` — sent to referrer when their referral is shortlisted

**5. Interview scheduled email template for direct candidates**
- Migration `0007_interview_scheduled_email_template` seeds `interview_scheduled_candidate` template — sent to any non-referred candidate when HR schedules their interview ✅

**6. Email triggers — referral submission**
- `_send_referral_submission_emails(candidate)` fires in background thread when a referred candidate is created via `POST /api/recruitment/candidates/`
- Sends 2 emails: one to referrer (`referral_submitted_referrer`), one to candidate (`referral_submitted_candidate`)

**7. Email triggers — interview scheduled**
- `_fire_interview_date_emails_if_needed(candidate, old_interview_date)` fires after any create or update that sets or changes `interview_date`
- Referred candidates → `_send_interview_scheduled_emails()` — 2 emails (candidate + referrer)
- Non-referred candidates → `_send_interview_scheduled_email_general()` — 1 email (candidate only)
- Triggered on: PUT, PATCH of existing candidate, and also on POST (candidate created with interview_date already set)
- Reschedule detection: any change where new `interview_date` is non-null AND different from old value triggers emails (not just null → value transitions)

### Bug Fixes Shipped

**8. Email templates sending variable placeholders instead of values**
- Root cause: migrations 0006 and 0007 used `get_or_create` — if the templates already existed in DB (from a previous dev session or manual creation), the correct bodies in `defaults` were silently skipped
- Fix: migration `0008_fix_email_template_bodies` uses `update_or_create` to force-overwrite subject, body, and `available_variables` for all 5 recruitment email templates regardless of prior DB state ✅

### Files Modified

```
backend/apps/recruitment/
  models.py           — ReferralRule model added

                        ReferralRuleListCreateView, ReferralRuleDetailView added;
                        interview email triggers wired into POST, PUT, PATCH
  urls.py             — 4 new referral URL patterns added

```

### Context Keys Sent by Each Email Helper

| Template | Context Keys Sent |
|---|---|
| `referral_submitted_referrer` | `referrer_name`, `candidate_name`, `position_applied`, `branch_name`, `company_name` |
| `referral_submitted_candidate` | `candidate_name`, `referrer_name`, `position_applied`, `company_name` |

## Session Log — 07-07-2026
**Author: G.Durga Prasad**
**Branch: Backend/referral**

### Features Shipped

**1. Referral bonus URL wiring — 4 missing routes added**
- `GET  /api/recruitment/referral-bonuses/` — list all referral bonus records (paginated, HR view)
- `GET  /api/recruitment/referral-bonuses/<pk>/` — single bonus record detail
- `POST /api/recruitment/referral-bonuses/<pk>/approve/` — HR approves a pending bonus
- `POST /api/recruitment/referral-bonuses/<pk>/pay/` — HR marks a bonus as paid
- Views (`ReferralBonusListView`, `ReferralBonusDetailView`, `ReferralBonusApproveView`, `ReferralBonusPayView`) already existed in `views.py`; they were just not wired in `urls.py`
- File: `backend/apps/recruitment/urls.py`

**2. Referral bonus migration — `ReferralBonus` model**
- Migration `0009_referralbonus` creates the `referral_bonus` table (OneToOne → Candidate, FK → referrer User, bonus_amount, status, approved_by, paid_by, timestamps)

### Bug Fixes Shipped

**3. `birthday_wish_sent_year` AttributeError — 500 on `/api/hrms/birthdays/`**
- Root cause: migration `0038_employeeprofile_birthday_wish_sent_year` had been applied (DB column existed), but the field was never added to the `EmployeeProfile` model class in `models.py`
- Python raised `AttributeError: 'EmployeeProfile' object has no attribute 'birthday_wish_sent_year'` on every birthdays request
- Fix: added `birthday_wish_sent_year = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField(null=True, blank=True)` to `EmployeeProfile` in `accounts/models.py` — no new migration needed (column already exists)
- File: `backend/apps/accounts/models.py`

### Backend Audit — Full Codebase Review

Comprehensive audit of all 7 Django apps completed. **115+ findings** identified across models, serializers, and views. Key categories:

| Severity | Count | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | 6 | `error(…, status=X)` TypeError in attendance views → 500; `return first_error()` returns string not Response → 500; `paginate()` called with wrong arg order → 500 |
| High | 28 | Missing `@transaction.atomic` on branch HR cascade / delete / geofence; leave approval not atomic; expense_number race condition; assessments PUT without `partial=True` |
| Medium | 52 | Wrong HTTP status codes (400 vs 409, 400 vs 404); permission checks using view perms for write ops; MIME type trusted from Content-Type header; unguarded service calls → 500 |
| Low | 35 | Missing `updated_at` on several models; integer PKs instead of UUIDs; `getLogger('branch')` instead of `__name__`; non-RESTful POST-aliases-PUT patterns |

**Files with critical/high findings:**

| File | Key Findings |
|---|---|
| `attendance/views/absence_alert.py` | `error(…, status=)` TypeError → 500; wrong `paginate()` arg order; `first_error()` returns string not Response; wrong permission system (`has_perm()` vs role-based) |
| `attendance/views/late_mark_lop.py` | Same 4 critical bugs as above |
| `attendance/views/settings_view.py` | PUT/PATCH use `settings.view` instead of `settings.edit` — view-only users can write |
| `attendance/views/hr_attendance.py` | Bare `except Exception: return False` swallows all DB errors; raw `list(page_obj)` without serializer |
| `assessments/views/admin.py` | PUT without `partial=True` resets boolean fields to defaults; unhandled ValueError for invalid UUID |
| `branch/views.py` | `_cascade_hr` + `branch.delete()` + geofencing save all missing `@transaction.atomic` |
| `branch/views_access.py` | Raw integer HTTP status codes (403, 409, 404) — `rest_framework.status` not imported |
| `announcements/views.py` | HTTP 204 response with JSON body (RFC violation); case-sensitive visibility queries |
| `hrms/views/expenses.py` | `select_for_update().aggregate()` doesn't lock rows → expense_number race → IntegrityError 500 |
| `hrms/views/leave.py` | Leave approval + balance deduction not in `transaction.atomic()`; L2 approver bypass |
| `recruitment/views.py` | HR reject makes no DB change; ₹0 bonus can be approved/paid; no status transition rules |
| `accounts/views.py` | JWT tokens returned in response body (Critical security violation); uncaught DoesNotExist → 500s |

**Fixes are pending — to be applied in the next session.**

### Files Changed

```
backend/apps/accounts/models.py      — birthday_wish_sent_year field added to EmployeeProfile
backend/apps/recruitment/urls.py     — 4 referral bonus URL patterns added
```
